## Rotated-Yolov3
Rotating target detection implemented with yolov3.

Not good enough yet, reach only Hmean 70 on ICDAR15 dataset. 

I'll not keep updating here, but PRs are welcomed. Better detector for rotation object detection will be published in my repo as soon as possible(that's why I deprecated ryolo). 

## Support 
* SEBlock  
* CUDA RNMS  
* riou loss  
* Inception module  
* DCNv2  
* ORN  

## Notice  
Feel free to contact me if you have any question when use this code, cause maybe I don't know either.(too long the last time I make modification on it, and I don't think yolo is a good choice for arbitrary orientation object detection.)  
I'll release a stronger detector later.

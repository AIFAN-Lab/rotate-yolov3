## Rotated-Yolov3
Rotating target detection implemented with yolov3.

Not good enough yet, reach only Hmean 70 on ICDAR15 dataset. 

I'll not keep updating here, but PRs are welcomed. Better detector for rotation object detection will be published in my repo as soon as possible(that's why I deprecated ryolo).
